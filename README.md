# Pathfinder Visualizer

This project was created using react. The project visualizes the chosen algorithm from a dropdown by showing the searching phase and the the found path using colored tiles.

The user may also generate a maze by the click of a button or create a maze themseves by clicking on the tiles to generate a wall. The user is also free to move the start and end tile.
