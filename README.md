# Pathfinder Visualizer

This project was created using react. The project visualizes the chosen algorithm by showing the searching phase and the the found path using colored tiles.

The user may also generate a map by the click of a button and create a maze themseves by clicking on the tiles to generate a wall. The user is also free to move the start and end tile
